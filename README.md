## Thank you for stumbling onto my Github! 

My name is Catherine. I'm currently a BCS undergraduate at the University of Waterloo. 

I've gained lots of knowledge from my software testing, application and full-stack development experiences. On the side, I've been enjoying game development, as well as UX/UI and PM responsibilities. In my free time, I enjoy digital art, weightlifting and hiphop. :dancer:
