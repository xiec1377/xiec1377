## Thank you for stumbling onto my Github! 

My name is Catherine. I'm currently an BCS undergraduate at the University of Waterloo. 

To be honest, in the beginning, I really didn't want to pursue computer science. I didn't think that it was for me. But now I'm here. And I'm discovering a lot of things about myself and my growing passion for the discipline. 

I've gained lots of knowledge from my software testing, application and full-stack development experiences. On the side, I've been enjoying game development and environmental design on Unity3D, as well as UX/UI and PM responsibilities. In my free time, I enjoy digital art, weightlifting and hiphop. :dancer:

### Nice meeting you! Have a good day!
