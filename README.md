My name is Catherine. I'm currently a 4th year BCS undergraduate at the University of Waterloo. 

I enjoy exploring different disciplines to become a more well-rounded individual. I have expertise in full-stack and front-end development, complemented by additional interests in product management and user experience & design, all cultivated through my experiences in the fintech sector.

In my free time, I enjoy digital art, weightlifting and dancing. :dancer:
