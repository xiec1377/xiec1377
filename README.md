Hi! 

I'm Catherine! I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science.

My expertise is in full-stack and front-end development, but I love exploring different areas to become more well-rounded. I recently picked up a strong interest in product management and UX design through my experiences as an engineer.

In my free time, I dabble in digital art, weightlifting and hip-hop dancing. :dancer:
